# web-scraping-challenge

## Description
This challenge consists of 2 parts:  
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News  
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data  
  
Using Beautiful Soup, I performed web scraping of news titles and their preview text from the Mars News Website (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html). I also used Beautiful Soup to scrape a data table from the Mars Temperature Data Site (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html). Then the data from the table was passed into a Pandas Dataframe for Analysis.

## Analysis

>What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?  
>*In Curiosity's location the coldest month is 3 and the hottest month is 8.*  

>Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?  
>*Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.*
